 *     This library uses the enhanced <em>pawndoc.xsl</em> from

 *   <remarks>
 *    <p>
 *    Provides efficient looping through sparse data sets, such as connected
 *    players.  Significantly improved from the original version to be a generic
 *    loop system, rather then purely a player loop system.  When used for
 *    players this has constant time O(n) for number of connected players (n),
 *    unlike standard player loops which are O(MAX_PLAYERS), regardless of the
 *    actual number of connected players.  Even when n is MAX_PLAYERS this is
 *    still faster.

 *   <subsection>Basic Iterators</subsection>
 *   
 *     <p>
 *     Basic iterators are simply collections of numbers - little more than an array.
 *     A number is either in the array, or not in the array, <em>y_iterate</em> loops
 *     through only the <em>in</em> numbers.</p>
 *     
 *     <p><em>Players</em><br /><br />
 *     
 *     This code will loop through every player connected to the server.
 *     
 *     <code>
 *     foreach (new i : Player)																				<br />
 *     {																				<br /><indent />
 *      printf("player %d is connected", i);																				<br />
 *     }
 *     </code>
 *     </p>
 *     
 *     <p><em>Vehicles</em><br /><br />
 *     
 *     This code will loop through all the created vehicles on the server (including
 *     those made in other running scripts).
 *     
 *     <code>
 *     foreach (new vid : Vehicle)																				<br />
 *     {																				<br /><indent />
 *      printf("vehicleid %d has been created", vid);																				<br />
 *     }
 *     </code>
 *     </p>
 *     
 *     <p><em>Create An Iterator</em><br /><br />
 *     
 *     To create your own iterator, first declare it, then add things to it, then loop
 *     over it:
 *     
 *     <code>
 *     new																				<br /><indent />
 *      Iterator:MyIter&lt;100&gt;; // First declare it (this has room for 100 items numbered 0-99).																				<br />
 *     // Then add things to it.																				<br />
 *     Iter_Add(MyIter, 0);  // Fine.																				<br />
 *     Iter_Add(MyIter, 55); // Fine.																				<br />
 *     Iter_Add(MyIter, 100); // Will fail.																				<br />
 *     // Then loop over it.																				<br />
 *     foreach (new i : MyIter)																				<br />
 *     {																				<br /><indent />
 *      printf("%d", i); // Will print "0" then "55".																				<br />
 *     }
 *     </code>
 *     </p>
